        <h1>AFRICA FOR YOU</h1>
        <p>African For You is a platform that enables content creators and viewers to view, like, comment and share the diversity and richness in  the African culture. <br>
          <br>
          Africa is known for its rich and diverse culture. Almost everything about us oozes culture and uniquesness, ranging from our hairdos, dressing, styles, foods, arts, music, skin color, religions, rituals and languages which are not readily published. <br>
          <br>
          We are therefore creating “Africa For You” a web monetization platform that will enable the African content creators and publishers to tell the undiluted story of Africa in all its fullness, glory, beauty, rawness for the world to behold and appreciate. <br>
          <br>
          This platform supports content creators to generate revenue from streamed payments from all over the world without worrying about the location, currency, or conversation rate. <br>
          <br>
          Africa For You pays continounsly as the user consumes content.</p>
